# Simply: Minimal Code for Frontier LLM Research in JAX

*Simply* is a minimal and scalable research codebase in JAX, designed for rapid iteration on frontier research in LLM and other autoregressive models.

- *Quick to [fork and hack](#getting-started)* for fast iteration. You should be able to implement your research ideas (e.g., new architecture, optimizer, training loss, etc) in a few hours.
- *Minimal abstractions and dependencies* for a simple and self-contained codebase. Learn [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (if you haven't), and you are ready to read and hack the code.
- That's it, *simply* [get started](#getting-started) with hacking now :)

## Getting started
### Example commands

#### Local test for debug
```shell
EXP=simply_local_test_1; rm -rf /tmp/${EXP}; python -m simply.main --experiment_config lm_test --experiment_dir /tmp/${EXP} --alsologtostderr
```
Or if you want to debug by printing arrays like normal python code, you can disable `jit` and `use_scan` using the command below.

```shell
export JAX_DISABLE_JIT=True; EXP=simply_local_test_1; rm -rf /tmp/${EXP}; python -m simply.main --experiment_config lm_no_scan_test --experiment_dir /tmp/${EXP} --alsologtostderr
```

## Dependencies

The main dependencies are:
[Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for model and training.
[Orbax](https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for checkpoint management.
[Grain](https://github.com/google/grain) for data pipeline.

Install dependencies:

```bash
# JAX installation is environment-specific. See https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html
# CPU:
pip install -U jax
# GPU:
pip install -U "jax[cuda13]"
# TPU:
pip install -U "jax[tpu]"
# Other dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Model Checkpoints and Datasets

Download datasets and model checkpoints in format supported by Simply from HuggingFace:

```bash
# Install huggingface_hub
pip install huggingface_hub

# Download both models and datasets
python setup/setup_assets.py

# Or download only models/datasets
python setup/setup_assets.py --models-only
python setup/setup_assets.py --datasets-only
```

This will download models to `~/.cache/simply/models/` and datasets to `~/.cache/simply/datasets/`. You can customize locations with `--models-dir` and `--datasets-dir` flags, or set environment variables `SIMPLY_MODELS` and `SIMPLY_DATASETS`. (Currently we only included a few datasets and models for testing, and will add more soon.)
